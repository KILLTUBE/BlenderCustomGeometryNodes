A word of warning:
 * I don't work a lot with Python
 * This can crash Blender during loading/unloading of the addon
 * I am just experimenting to see what is possible

Install:
 * Just clone this repo in your `blender-2.92.0\2.92\scripts\addons\` folder

Interesting files to learn from:
 * `blender-2.92.0\2.92\scripts\startup\nodeitems_builtins.py`
